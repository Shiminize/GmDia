# GmDia UI Bug Fix & Tailwind CSS Optimization PRD

## Project Overview
Fix critical CSS import errors and conduct comprehensive UI optimization for the GmDia luxury jewelry e-commerce website. The application is currently broken due to missing CSS file imports and needs a complete Tailwind CSS implementation review and optimization.

## Current Critical Issues

### 1. Missing CSS File Imports (Priority: Critical)
- `./src/index.tsx` references deleted `./assets/styles/index.css`
- `./src/pages/SizingGuide.tsx` references deleted `../assets/styles/index.css`
- These imports prevent the application from compiling

### 2. UI Layout Inconsistencies (Priority: High)
- Navigation layout issues potentially still present
- Component styling conflicts between legacy CSS and Tailwind
- Responsive design inconsistencies across components

### 3. Tailwind CSS Integration (Priority: High)
- Ensure all components use Tailwind classes consistently
- Verify custom color palette implementation
- Optimize utility class usage for performance

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4.1.11 (current implementation)
- React Router for navigation
- Luxury jewelry brand aesthetic with colors:
  - Ivory White (#FFFFFF)
  - Graphite Black (#1A1A1A) 
  - Champagne Beige (#EFE7DD)
  - Muted Blush (#F5DADF)
  - Pale Sage (#DCEDE4)
  - Digital Lavender (#CDB4DB)

### Component Architecture
- Fully responsive mobile-first design
- Reusable component library with Tailwind
- Consistent typography (Georgia primary, Inter secondary)
- Luxury brand animations and interactions

## Deliverables

1. **Critical Bug Fixes**
   - Remove all broken CSS imports
